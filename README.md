In this exercise, you were able to create a full server allowing users to implement all CRUD operations for two kinds of resources: Expressions and Animals! With these skills and knowledge of the HTTP request-response cycle, you could implement an API for any project needing CRUD functionality. You could build a trip planner, an address book, a grocery list, an image-sharing application, an anonymous message board, the sky’s the limit!
